# Polymind MVP (Experimental / In-Progress)

**Polymind** is an experimental multi-persona AI MVP built on top of the [Arkaine](https://github.com/hlfshell/arkaine) framework.  
Its goal is to demonstrate a Jungian-inspired approach to AI—combining multiple “persona” agents (e.g., Persona, Shadow, Anima) into a unified response.

> **Important:** This project is still **in development** and may be partially or entirely **broken** in its current state. Use at your own risk.

---

## Overview

1. **Multi-Persona Concept:**  
   - We define several “persona” agents (Persona, Shadow, Anima, etc.) using Arkaine’s `SimpleAgent` class, each offering a unique viewpoint.
   - Their outputs are then merged by an aggregator tool (the “Self”), aiming to provide a more holistic response to user prompts.

2. **Arkaine Integration:**  
   - Uses Arkaine’s core classes (`Tool`, `SimpleAgent`, `Argument`) to build agents.
   - Attempts to use or has used Arkaine’s flow classes (`Branch`, `Linear`), but encountered version mismatches leading to errors.

3. **Current Status:**  
   - **Broken / Incomplete** – The code may fail at runtime due to mismatched Arkaine versions or older constructor signatures.  
   - We’re collaborating with the Arkaine creator to resolve these compatibility issues.

## Directory Structure

Here’s a simplified outline of the main directories and files:

```
polymind/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py                # Entry point for running the MVP
│   ├── persona_agents.py      # Definitions of Persona, Shadow, Anima
│   ├── aggregator.py          # Tool that merges persona outputs
│   ├── pipeline.py            # (Optional) pipeline/flow code
│   └── (other Python files)   # Additional experimental code
├── arkaine/                   # Local copy of Arkaine (or submodules)
│   ├── tools/
│   ├── toolbox/

├── venv/                      # Python virtual environment
├── .env                       # Environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)

```

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone/Download** this repository.
2. **Create or activate** a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. **Install dependencies** from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set your environment** variables in `.env` (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx`).

---

## Running (Might Be Broken!)

1. **Navigate** to the `src/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd src
   ```
2. **Run** `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Potential Errors**:  
   - You may see `TypeError` or `AttributeError` due to mismatched Arkaine signatures.  
   - `_executor` warnings are common in older Arkaine versions but usually harmless.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Version Mismatch**:  
  The local Arkaine code in `arkaine/` may not match the installed PyPI version. Try:
  ```bash
  pip uninstall arkaine
  pip install -e /path/to/arkaine  # If you have a local dev copy
  ```
- **Flow Constructors**:  
  If you see errors about `concurrency`, `formatters`, or missing arguments, check the `Branch` and `Linear` constructors in `arkaine/flow/`. The code in `pipeline.py` must match those signatures.
- **Manual Pipeline**:  
  An alternative is to **avoid** `Branch`/`Linear` entirely and create a single custom tool that calls each persona agent and merges results manually (see `pipeline_func` examples).

---

## Current Limitations

- **Partial Implementation**: Some code references older or newer Arkaine features that may not align with the local version.
- **No Guarantee of Functionality**: The MVP might fail to run end-to-end until the Arkaine version mismatch is resolved.
- **No Production Readiness**: This is purely an experimental prototype, not meant for production use.

---

## Roadmap / Next Steps

1. **Sync with Arkaine**:  
   - Coordinate with the Arkaine maintainer to finalize stable signatures for `Branch`, `Linear`, `Tool`, and `SimpleAgent`.
   - Update local references to match that stable version.
2. **Polish the Persona Flow**:  
   - Finalize a “Self aggregator” that merges each persona’s output in a single pass or iterative loop.
   - Optionally add concurrency or iterative refinement once the version issues are solved.
3. **Add Testing**:  
   - Implement basic tests (e.g., `pytest`) for each persona agent and aggregator logic.
